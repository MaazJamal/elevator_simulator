Elevator simulation is a software to simulate the operations of multiple elevators in a commercial building, by creating an algorithm.\hypertarget{md_doc__developer__manual_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Requirement}\label{md_doc__developer__manual_autotoc_md1}
Software simulates Elevator scheduling in a building for an day by reading the input file with Paaseger ID,timestamp,start and destination floor. The text file must be stored in data/input.\+txt.\hypertarget{md_doc__developer__manual_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Assumption}\label{md_doc__developer__manual_autotoc_md2}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item User gives the number of floors and elevators in the building, the value should be less than or equal to 100.
\item The elevators are assumed to be at the same location in the building.
\item At the start of the simulation all the elevators are assumed to be on the 1st floor.
\item The weight of each passenger is assumed to be constant. This allows the simulator to establish weight limits as the number of passengers in the elevator.
\item A fixed time has been assumed for lifts to move from x floor to x+1 and x-\/1 floors.\+Each elevator takes 3 seconds to go from one floor to another floor.
\item The time that the elevator stops on a floor depends on that number of passengers getting in or out. It is assumed that it takes 2 sec for a passenger to get in or out. So the stop time of an elevator at a floor will be 2n, where n is the number of passengers getting in or out of the lift.
\item The elevators are assumed to have a single entry point for both exit and entry.

The program flow for the application is as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8c}{main.\+c}} file calls the functions for static\+\_\+simulation and in release 2 dynamc\+\_\+simulation based on user input to run the alogorithm.
\item The static\+\_\+simulation/dynamc\+\_\+simulation function calls\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The function in \mbox{\hyperlink{input__lifts_8c}{input\+\_\+lifts.\+c}} to get number of lifts from the user.
\item The function in \mbox{\hyperlink{input__floors_8c}{input\+\_\+floors.\+c}} to get number of floors from the user.
\item The function in \mbox{\hyperlink{create__elevator__array_8c}{create\+\_\+elevator\+\_\+array.\+c}} to create array for every elevator.
\item The function in \mbox{\hyperlink{create__floor__array_8c}{create\+\_\+floor\+\_\+array.\+c}} to create array for every floor to hold waiting passeger.
\item The function in \mbox{\hyperlink{count__passenger_8c}{count\+\_\+passenger.\+c}} to count the number of passenger in the input file.
\item The function in \mbox{\hyperlink{read__passenger_8c}{read\+\_\+passenger.\+c}} to store the passenger details to passenger structure.
\item The function in \mbox{\hyperlink{add__request__queue_8c_source}{add\+\_\+request\+\_\+queue.\+c}} to add passenger requests to a queue.
\item The function in \mbox{\hyperlink{is__lift__on__floor_8c}{is\+\_\+lift\+\_\+on\+\_\+floor.\+c}} to check the lift status. If it is moving or not.
\item The function in \mbox{\hyperlink{passengers__drop_8c}{passengers\+\_\+drop.\+c}} to drop the passenger at the floor returning number of passengers dropped.
\item The function in passenger\+\_\+takein.\+c to take the passenger on floor based on maiximum count and space in elevator.
\item The function in \mbox{\hyperlink{add__passenger__floor_8c_source}{add\+\_\+passenger\+\_\+floor.\+c}} to add passenger to the floor array.
\item The function in \mbox{\hyperlink{remove__passenger__queue_8c}{remove\+\_\+passenger\+\_\+queue.\+c}} to remove the passenger from request queue.
\item The function in \mbox{\hyperlink{moving__lift__down_8c}{moving\+\_\+lift\+\_\+down.\+c}} to change lift direction to down.
\item The function in moving\+\_\+lift\+\_\+up.\+cc to change the lift direction to up.
\item The function in \mbox{\hyperlink{average__waiting__time_8c}{average\+\_\+waiting\+\_\+time.\+c}} to calculate the average and waiting time.
\item The function in maximum\+\_\+waiting\+\_\+time.\+c to calculate maximum waiting time.
\item The function in \mbox{\hyperlink{is__lift__empty_8c}{is\+\_\+lift\+\_\+empty.\+c}} to check the space in elevator
\item The function in \mbox{\hyperlink{remove__passenger__floor_8c}{remove\+\_\+passenger\+\_\+floor.\+c}} to remove the passenger from the floor array. The dynamc\+\_\+simulation also calls these functions\+:
\item The function in input\+\_\+static\+\_\+dynamic.\+c to get whether user want static or dynamic simulation.
\item The function in read\+\_\+user\+\_\+input\+\_\+validate.\+c to read and validate the inputs from user console for a passenger.
\item The function in emergency\+\_\+stop\+\_\+handling.\+c to to bring the lifts to nearest floor incase of emergency.
\item The function in \mbox{\hyperlink{cli__update_8c_source}{cli\+\_\+update.\+c}} to display elevator information on screen.
\item The function in \mbox{\hyperlink{input__after__stop_8c}{input\+\_\+after\+\_\+stop.\+c}} to get input from user when emergency situation encountered.
