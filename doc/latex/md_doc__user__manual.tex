Elevator\+\_\+\+Simulation is a software that operates any number of elevator in a commercial building with given number of floors.\hypertarget{md_doc__user__manual_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{md_doc__user__manual_autotoc_md6}
Please refer to \href{https://github.com/MaazJamal/elevator_simulator/blob/devel/INSTALL.md}{\texttt{ I\+N\+S\+T\+A\+L\+L.\+md}} file for installation instructions.\hypertarget{md_doc__user__manual_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{md_doc__user__manual_autotoc_md7}
The user needs to provide the software with a text file containing the passenger request detail for the elevator. The text file is named input.\+txt and must be placed in the \char`\"{}data\char`\"{} folder. The relative path is data/input.\+txt. The maximum number of floors in this file should correspond to what the user enters later in the program.

To start the program in windows either click on elevator.\+exe or type elevator.\+exe in command line. For cygwin/unix type ./elevator to start execution.

The program will ask for the following parameters at the execution of Elevator\+\_\+\+Simulation\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Static or Dynamic version \+: Press 0 to select Static Version or 1 to select Dynaic version. (Only for realease 2 version of program.)
\item Number of lifts \+: Specifies the number lifts in the building should be in the range of 1 to 100.
\item Number of elevators\+: Specifies the number elevators in the building should be in thr range of 1 to 100.
\item Input file should be placed in the right path.\+Change the input file if needed. In the data/ folder
\end{DoxyItemize}

In case of Dynamic version


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add Passenger request \+: If needed pass passenger request manually in the same format as Input file.
\item Decide on the simulation when encountered a emergency stop condition. Press 1 to continue simulation or 0 to terminate the simulation.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Please note that the binary is located in project {\ttfamily root} folder


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{.elevator}
\end{DoxyCode}


for windows


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{elevator.exe}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_doc__user__manual_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{Testing}\label{md_doc__user__manual_autotoc_md8}
Unit testing is done for each functions defined in the software. The test cases can be run using the command below\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./tests}
\end{DoxyCode}


for windows


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{tests.exe}
\end{DoxyCode}


Note\+: You must have compiled the tests.\+exe program as well.\hypertarget{md_doc__user__manual_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{Output Generation}\label{md_doc__user__manual_autotoc_md9}
Below output files will be generated and placed \href{https://github.com/MaazJamal/elevator_simulator/blob/devel/data/}{\texttt{ here}}

Output file 1 -\/ File that gives Passenger$\ast$\+ID,Elevator\+\_\+\+ID,Passenger\+\_\+\+In time,Passenger$\ast$ Entry floor,Passenger$\ast$\+Out time,Passenger$\ast$ Exit floor

Output file 2 -\/ File that gives Average waiting time of Passengers and Maximum waiting time of a Passenger.
